Project Overview
The Hydroponics Fodder Machine aims to develop an innovative and automated system that utilizes hydroponics for producing high-quality fodder. This sustainable approach addresses the growing demand for efficient livestock feed while minimizing resource use.

Goals
-Automated Production: Streamline the process of growing fodder to reduce labor and increase efficiency.
-Sustainability: Use less water and land compared to traditional farming methods.
-Nutritional Quality: Ensure the fodder produced meets the dietary needs of livestock.
